CSIT 505 Summer 2020
Analysis of Star Wars Episode V script to look for insights into characters based off of
  - number of lines in script
  - total number of words spoken
  - positive / negative words used in script
  - which characters have the most "script space" (word count/line count)
  - which characters are the most positive/negative (word count/frequency of said words)
  - sentiment analysis
      - ngrams for context
      - positive/negative word choice
      
This is still a work in progress!
