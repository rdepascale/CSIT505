PROOF OF CONCEPT
iterate through file
	split/strip so it is name then text line after line
create dictionary key (name) : value (line)
iterate through dictionary (maybe not dictinoary)
	create dictionarys
	key (name)
	    : value (# lines)
	    : value (num chars in line)
	    : value (words in line)
create histograms
       name vs # lines
       name vs # chars
       name vs words

- Read file
	- scan for all caps (name) between ""
		- store as string variable
	- scan for next set of "indicates dialog"
		- store as int of character count
		- store as int # of whitespace + 1 = # of words
	- input into temp list ["NAME", character instance, #char, #word]
		- input int list of list for later (final) use

============
DONE:
- read file
- store text lines into array line_values [['character name', word, word, etc.],...]
- transform line_values into list_tally with sublist elements:
	- alphabetic by unique character names
	- # of total spoken lines
	- # of total spoken words
- output results to graphs of x (name) vs y (word or line) or vs y/z (word & line)

TO-DO:
- help prep word analysis by stripping any punctuation from list_lines
- sentiment analysis:
	- build arrays of positive & negative words:
		- https://positivewordsresearch.com/list-of-negative-words/
	- iterate through list_lines and any hits should be appended to list_tally
	- append # of hits for pos/neg words and character name
- iterate through line_list to make unique list of  character name and ALL words
	- use this to look for most frequent words spoken
- n-Grams of word frequency/etc.
