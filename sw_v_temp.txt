"1" "LUKE" "Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you  read me?"
"2" "HAN" "Loud and clear, kid. What's up?"
"3" "LUKE" "Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any  life readings."
"4" "HAN" "There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a  space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back."
"5" "LUKE" "Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite  that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long."
"6" "LUKE" "Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?"
"7" "LUKE" "Aaargh!"
"8" "HAN" "Chewie!"
"9" "HAN" "All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give  you a hand."
"10" "RIEEKAN" "Solo?"
"11" "HAN" "No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around."
"12" "RIEEKAN" "Commander Skywalker reported in yet?"
"13" "HAN" "No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him."
"14" "RIEEKAN" "With all the meteor activity in this  system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
"15" "HAN" "General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore."
"16" "RIEEKAN" "I'm sorry to hear that."
"17" "HAN" "Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the  Hut, I'm a dead man."
"18" "RIEEKAN" "A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good  fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you."
"19" "HAN" "Thank you, General."
"20" "HAN" "Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it."
"21" "LEIA" "That's right."
"22" "HAN" "Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess."
"23" "LEIA" "Han!"
"24" "HAN" "Yes, Your Highnessness?"
"25" "LEIA" "I thought you decided to stay."
